Let's talk about email and communication with A I.

Email is a time sink for most people. A I can help you handle it faster without sacrificing quality.

Drafting replies. Share the email you received and ask A I to draft a response. Specify the tone you want. Review and send. What used to take ten minutes can take two.

Summarizing long threads. When you receive a long email chain, paste it in and ask for the key points. Get up to speed quickly.

Handling difficult messages. Not sure how to respond to something sensitive? Ask A I for suggestions. It can help you find the right words.

Batch processing. Have a bunch of similar emails? Create templates with A I and customize quickly.

Beyond email, A I helps with all kinds of personal communication.

Text messages you're not sure how to word. Birthday or thank you notes that don't sound generic. Letters or messages for tricky situations.

A I doesn't replace your voice. It helps you find it faster.

The key is making this a habit. When you sit down to handle communication, open A I alongside your inbox. It becomes a natural part of how you work.
