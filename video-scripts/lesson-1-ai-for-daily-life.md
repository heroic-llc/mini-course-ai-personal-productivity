Welcome to A I for Personal Productivity.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course shows you how to use A I to get more done in your daily life.

This video was made with the help of an A I tool, allowing us to keep content current.

We all have the same twenty four hours. The question is how to use them well. A I can help.

A I isn't just for work. It's a tool for managing your life more effectively. Email, planning, learning, organizing. All the things that pile up when you're busy.

The promise isn't that A I will do everything for you. It's that A I handles the tedious parts so you can focus on what matters.

In this course, you'll learn how to manage email and communication faster, organize and plan more effectively, learn new skills with A I as a tutor, and build habits that stick.

These aren't complicated techniques. They're practical ways to use A I for the things you already do, just better.

Let's reclaim some of your time.
